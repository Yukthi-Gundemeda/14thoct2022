	<p class="pawankalyan">Pawan Kalyan is the first leader who opposed BJP lead central government for not granting Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh. He called Special Package as just an eye wash.[26] He later attended a huge public gathering Seemandhrula Atma Gaurava Sabha in Kakinada on 9 Sep 2016 demanding Special Category Status.[27] He slammed Narendra Modi, Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley and urged AP M.P's to learn Hindi to demand Special Category Status in Parliament. 4th formation day of JSP was conducted at Acharya Nagarjuna University grounds on March 14, 2018. The meeting started with cultural activities followed by party president's speech. Kalyan criticized both central and state governments in this meeting. He mainly targeted Arun Jaitley, N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nara Lokesh for their poor governance and corruption. He said "I supported the TDP and the BJP parties during the general elections held in 2014 with a hope that they would rebuild the state which had no Capital and no financial resources. But the state government has belied my hopes and the aspirations of crores of people. Why should I support these parties which have betrayed the people?" He questioned Chandrababu Naidu about his son's corruption. He said "Don't you know about your son Lokesh's corruption? Are you letting him do it despite your knowledge? if so, I'm leaving it to your wisdom. You have satisfied no one. You have lost the faith of people including mine." He went on one-day hunger strike for proper caring of patients in Uddanam in 2018. Kalyan opposed the central government's move to privatize the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI),[28][29] and the TDP government's decision on land pooling.[30] He led a protest march to commemorate farmers who committed suicide or migrated from the drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema,[31] and later organized a march on the historical Dowleswaram Barrage, Rajahmundry, demanding political accountability.[32] The JSP Chief exposed the alleged unchecked mining in the reserve forest area at Vanthada Village of Prathipadu, East Godavari district.[33] The prime objective of Jana Sena Party has been to ensure equal power to all social groups of people.</p>
